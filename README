gradience.py -- version 0.1
=========================================================================
Adds into the material properties panel, at the bottom, checkboxes three.

One each for diffuse_ramp,specular_ramp,and the texture color ramp.

So far, only rgb and roygbiv, but easy to add more.

    At present, this code is only two days old, so not really any features,
such as one might wish to import for example .grd files or at least have
basic load/save/new functionality.  Nope.  None of that.  ( Yet? )

OLL KORRECT!
